#Java-Speech API Credits

##Credits
The following people/organizations have helped provide functionality for the API,

* JavaFlacEncoder Project
    * Provided functionality to convert Wave files to FLAC format
        * This allowed for the FLAC audio to be sent to Google to be "recognized"
    * Created by Preston Lacey
    * Homepage: http://sourceforge.net/projects/javaflacencoder/
* Google
    * Provided functionality for two main API functions
        * Recognizer
            * Allows for speech audio to be recognized to text
        * Synthesiser
            * Allows for text to speech translation
    * Homepage: http://google.com

I would like to thank the above so much for your work, this wrapper/API could not have been
created without it.
