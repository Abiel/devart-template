## Description
Clairvoyant 1.0
Our diversity, is a feature that could bring variety in our understanding of our socio-cultural interactions, our perception and value of the planet we live in. But, unfortunatelly, diversity is also the root of racism and people not appeciating the different others.
Clairvoyant - A spherical ball - an out door installation (radius 3 meters) with rotating map on it that visually takes a user to any part of the world to show a city, the diversity of people in the city and other features of that area.
A user comes close to the sphere and names a city (verbally) - a microphone in the base of the sphere processes the speech and feeds the data to google maps api to get the coordinates of the venue/city. The sphere rotates to focus on that sphere and zooms in to display features of the venue as well as a social diversity of people in that area.

When no input is fed to Clairvoyant, it rotates to show the rotation of the planet around its axis

Clairvoyant 2.0 
Multiple spherical installations of clairvoyant in different cities enabling different people to exchange handwaves, smiles and friendly gestures.
